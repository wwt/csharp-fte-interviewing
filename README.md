# Welcome to C# Interviewing, the place for pairing C# problems

If you're applying for an C#/.Net development position at World Wide Technology Application Services then this is the repo for you!

### Instructions

Someone started to implement a music album API using test driven development (TDD), but got distracted after writing the tests and didn't actually implement to code to pass the tests! Your goal is to finish writing the API to get the tests (and possibly add new tests as you see fit).

BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS:

- Provide an API to allow users to quickly find the music they are interested in. There are some repository methods defined on an interface, your job is to finish implementing them and connect them to the controllers to be able to serve up the data to users.

You are free to change _anything_ about the current code so long as you accomplish this goal. Make it read and function the way you want it to, but bear in mind weâ€™re looking for people who understand what best industry practices look like in C#.

NOTE: The code in its current state does not compile, that's on purpose because there's placeholders in place.
